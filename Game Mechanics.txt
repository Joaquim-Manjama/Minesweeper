Minesweeper is a classic logic-based puzzle game where the player uncovers a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the game mechanics and how it works:

### **1. Grid Setup**
- **Grid Sizes:** Common grids are small (8x8), medium (16x16), or large (16x30). Custom sizes can be allowed.
- **Mines:** Mines are randomly placed on the grid, and the number depends on the difficulty level:
  - Easy: ~10% of the grid contains mines.
  - Medium: ~15-20%.
  - Hard: ~25-30%.
- **Empty Spaces:** The rest of the grid contains "safe" squares.

### **2. Objective**
- Uncover all squares without mines.
- Mark all mines with flags.

### **3. Core Mechanics**
- **Uncovering Squares:** Clicking (or interacting) with a square can:
  - Reveal a number (indicating the number of adjacent mines).
  - Uncover an empty area (if no adjacent mines exist).
  - Trigger a mine (game over).
- **Flagging:** Right-click or equivalent action to mark suspected mine locations with flags.
- **Win Condition:** All non-mine squares are revealed, and all mines are flagged.

### **4. Adjacent Squares**
- Each square can have up to 8 adjacent squares (diagonal, vertical, and horizontal).
- Numbers on revealed squares indicate the total mines among these adjacent squares.

### **5. Special Features**
- **Chain Reaction:** Uncovering a square with no adjacent mines automatically reveals surrounding squares until numbers or grid edges are reached.
- **First Click Guarantee:** The first click is always safe and does not uncover a mine.
- **Timer:** Tracks how long the player takes to solve the grid.
- **Flag Count:** Displays the number of flags placed versus total mines.

### **6. User Interface**
- **Grid:** Displays squares that can be clicked.
- **Indicators:** Timer, mine counter, restart button.
- **Visual Feedback:** Different states for flagged, revealed, and unrevealed squares.

### **7. Input/Interaction**
- **Mouse/Keyboard/Touch Controls:** Adaptable for various platforms.
- **Restart Game:** Reset the grid while keeping track of high scores if applicable.

### **8. Game States**
- **Active:** Ongoing game.
- **Win:** All safe squares uncovered and all mines flagged.
- **Loss:** Mine triggered.

### **9. Optional Enhancements**
- **Custom Difficulty:** Allow users to choose grid size and mine density.
- **High Scores:** Track fastest times.
- **Hints:** Limited hints to reveal if a square is safe or not.
- **Themes:** Customizable grid and mine designs.
